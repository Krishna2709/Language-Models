# Language-Models

### Building Language Models Inspired by 
- Sebastian Raschka
- Andrej Karpathy
- Natural Language Processing with Transformers - Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, Thomas Wolf
- Generative Deep Learning - David Foster


### Goal
- To understand how language models work
- To utilize Tensorflow, PyTorch, and HuggingFace libraries
- To design language models from scratch
- To train, evaluate, and deploy language models
- To implement various techniques like Self-Attention | Flash-Attention ...
- To quantize language models and reduce inference time
- To convert the models into ONNX format and deploy them on mobile devices
- To run language models on edge devices
- To optimize open-source models from *Anarchy*
